# CS-250 Final Project - Sprint Review and Retrospective

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts by understanding what the user wants to achieve and why. Creating user stories helps translate those needs into a clear, actionable format. By writing user stories from the perspective of the user, such as “As a traveler, I want to see the top destinations so I can pick a fun place to go” it becomes easier to focus on the value each feature provides. This process ensures the work we do aligns with user expectations and helps guide development decisions.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I now approach development in smaller, more manageable chunks using Agile principles. I prefer working in sprints, breaking down features into user stories, and constantly checking in through daily standups. Agile helps keep things organized and flexible, allowing room to make improvements as we go. In future projects, I want to continue using sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog prioritization so I can stay adaptable and deliver working software more efficiently.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means being reliable, communicative, and open to feedback. It’s not just about writing code—it’s about collaborating, solving problems together, and making sure everyone is aligned. I’ve learned that sharing progress, raising concerns early, and supporting others when they’re stuck helps the whole team succeed. Good teamwork leads to better results, a better product, and a better experience for everyone involved.
